# openai-mcp-server/openai_mcp_server/__init__.py
# This file makes Python treat the `openai_mcp_server` directory as a package.

# You could optionally re-export main components if desired, e.g.:
# from .server import mcp as openai_mcp_instance
# from .openai_wrapper import generate_chat_completion
